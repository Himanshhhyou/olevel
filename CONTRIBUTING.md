# Contributing to LearnAngle

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LearnAngle! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to this project.

## üåø Branch Strategy

### Main Branches

- **main**: The primary branch containing stable, production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features (if used)

### Creating Feature Branches

All development work should be done in dedicated branches. Follow these steps:

#### 1. Update Your Local Repository

```bash
# Fetch the latest changes
git fetch origin

# Make sure you're on main branch
git checkout main

# Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main
```

#### 2. Create a New Branch

Use descriptive branch names following this convention:

```bash
# For new features
git checkout -b feature/short-description

# For bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description

# For documentation
git checkout -b docs/what-you-are-documenting

# For styling/formatting
git checkout -b style/what-you-are-styling

# For code refactoring
git checkout -b refactor/what-you-are-refactoring
```

**Examples:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-chapter3-tests
git checkout -b fix/broken-navigation-links
git checkout -b docs/add-setup-instructions
git checkout -b style/improve-mobile-responsiveness
git checkout -b refactor/simplify-test-filters
```

#### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add comments where necessary
- Test your changes thoroughly

#### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add Chapter 3 tests for HTML forms"
```

**Commit Message Guidelines:**
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Be specific and descriptive
- Reference issue numbers if applicable (e.g., "Fix #123: Navigation bug")
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Add detailed description in body if needed

**Good commit messages:**
```
Add search functionality to online tests
Fix mobile menu not closing on link click
Update README with installation instructions
Refactor CSS for better maintainability
```

#### 5. Push Your Branch

```bash
# Push your branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/your-branch-name
```

#### 6. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click "Pull requests" ‚Üí "New pull request"
3. Select your branch
4. Fill in the PR template with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Screenshots (if UI changes)
   - Testing steps
   - Related issues
